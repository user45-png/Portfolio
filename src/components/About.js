      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
  I'm a curious and driven <strong>Computer Science Engineering student</strong> with a strong passion for building impactful technology. My expertise spans across
  <strong> Artificial Intelligence</strong>, <strong>Web Development</strong>, and <strong>Networking</strong>, with a particular interest in semantic systems that connect people and data meaningfully.
</p>
<p>
  I enjoy turning ideas into reality through code â€” whether it's designing intuitive web apps, automating processes, or exploring the boundaries of intelligent systems. I'm a quick learner who thrives in collaborative environments and values clean, scalable solutions.
</p>
<p>
  Beyond development, I have a growing enthusiasm for <strong>ethical hacking</strong>, system architecture, and open-source contribution. I'm eager to connect with teams and projects where I can keep learning, solving, and creating.
